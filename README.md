# World ID Next.js Template

This is a template repository for creating a new project using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and the [World ID SDK](https://id.worldcoin.org). This template isn't intended for use cases that require on-chain verification, but rather for use cases that leverage off-chain web backend verification.

## Getting Started

First, set the correct Node.js version using `nvm` and run the development server:

```bash
nvm use 20
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your World ID App ID and Action Name to the appropriate variables.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This template includes a server action to verify the proof returned by the IDKit widget at `src/app/actions/verify.ts`. Edit this file to handle any backend functions you need to perform after the proof has been verified.

You can start editing the client-side page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. Edit the `onSuccess` function to define frontend behavior once the proof has been verified.
